                <p id="explain">

                    SEKAIs are accessible to anyone possessing an “Untitled” track. It is a very mysterious song, completely devoid of melodies or lyrics, which is found in gadgets of those who have a strong feeling. It functions as a pass to the SEKAI, a place where people can be in touch with their feelings and make up songs. As the characters play “Untitled”, they are taken to the respective SEKAI, where they feel and develop themselves through music. A set of personalized worlds built up out of the characters' feelings, where "Untitled" is the entrance to. As characters further explore into their SEKAI, the song changes, depicting their emotional evolution and expression. The SEKAI will guide a person who is  trying to define and deliver their inner voice to the world — through music. <br><br>

                    It is said that a SEKAI appears to those people who failed to understand themselves. An “Untitled” will appear to their devices, upon playing this song a SEKAI will be formed. SEKAIs will be different from person to person. Upon entering the SEKAI, they will meet the VIRTUAL SINGERS who lives there. VIRTUAL SINGERS will help these people to discover their "True Feelings".
