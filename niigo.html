            <h2>Nightcord at 25:00</h2>
            <p><em>"A mysterious music circle that operates at 1:00 AM (25:00), and whose identities are shrouded in mystery."</em> <br> <br>
            Nightcord at 25:00 is an anonymous music unit. Their members remain anonymous, their identities hidden behind the veil of the internet. <br>
            The unit's name, "Nightcord at 25:00," refers to the late-night hour (1:00 am) when they are most active. Their music is often characterized by its melancholic and introspective tone, reflecting the themes of loneliness, isolation, and self-discovery that are explored in their songs. </p>
        
            <p>Nightcord at 25:00 is composed of 4 members: <br>
                <br>Yoisaki Kanade "K" (Composer)
                <br>Asahina Mafuyu "Yuki" (Lyricist)
                <br>Shinonome Ena "Enanan" (Illustrator)
                <br>Akiyama Mizuki "Amia" (MV Creator)
                </p>

            <p>"K" formed the circle with the goal of creating music that "saves people" and gives them hope. She recruits "Enanan", "Amia", and "Yuki", they communicate via a chat tool called "Nightcord." None of the members knew each other's real names or appearance until later in the story. </p>
